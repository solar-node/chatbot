      "Final Answer: Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. Instead of being explicitly programmed for every task, machine learning algorithms are trained on large datasets, allowing them to improve their performance over time as they are exposed to more data. Key concepts include supervised learning (where the model learns from labeled data), unsupervised learning (where it finds patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (where an agent learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment). It's used in a vast array of applications, from recommendation systems and natural language processing to medical diagnosis and autonomous vehicles.\u001b[0m\n",
